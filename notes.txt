major features:
	rules:
		- universe definition
			establishes the environment in which everything happens: what features exist, what values of features are available for a given segment to express, a hierarchy of natural classes
		- sound change definitions
			basically just context-sensitive-grammar rewrite rules, but uses feature vectors instead of characters; matches natural classes
		- syllable definitions
			syllable composition, sonority hierarchy
				sonority hierarchy amounts to a ranking among natural classes (independent, though necessarily informed by, the hierarchy of natural classes defined in the universe definition)
		- word definitions
			composing words out of syllables
		- note: syllables and words are flat sequences of segments (fully-specified natural classes)
	group:
		- allows a single alias to stand for multiple things of the same kind; works for:
			- natural classes (although it might make more sense to create a new natural class)
			- sound changes
			- syllable definitions
	queries:
		- generate
			- syllable
			- word
		- apply sound change
		- analyze word, syllable
			- given sonority, likely syllable structure
			- given syllable structure, likely sonority hierarchy

universe definition syntax:
	'<upper-level-name> <op> <lower-level-name>'
		<upper-level-name> is the name of the natural class under which the new natural class is defined
		<op> is either '!' or '?'
			'?' indicates that a segment must express each of this class's children
				e.g. place and means of articulation under 'ipa'
			'!' indicates that  a segment can express only one of the class's children
				e.g. labial and coronal under 'place of articulation'
		<lower-level-name> is the name that will be given to the new class
	'<op> <lower-level-name>'
		used for top-level class

sound change rule definition syntax:
	'<from-match> / <to-match> / <left-env> _ <right-env>'
		<rule-name>: name that is assigned to this rule
		if <from-match> matches a segment within the environment, it will be overwritten with <to-match>
		only those specifications (e.g. + coronal) in <to-match> will be overwritten

feature vectors:
	'[ +x, -y, ... ]'
		where x and y are natural classes that this feature vector will attempt to match
		basically, what you would expect

syllable and word definitions:
	syllable definitions are strings of feature vectors
	word definitions are strings of syllable
